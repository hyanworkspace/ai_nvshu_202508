"communicate Chinese in a world where they were denied formal education."
msgstr ""

#: templates/about.html:52
msgid ""
"This is the first art project to interpret Nüshu from a computational "
"linguistics perspective. Two AI agents simulate how ancient women developed "
"a unique language under the constraints of a patriarchal society. This "
"cultural phenomenon resonates with the emergence of non-human machine "
"language under human authority, both metaphorically and practically. "
"Essentially, we integrate cultural phenomena into an AI system."
msgstr ""

#: templates/about.html:60
msgid ""
"Contrary to the predefined rules like Morse code, Markov chains, and "
"fictional constructed languages, AI Nüshu evolves organically from the "
"machine's environmental observations and feedback, mirroring the natural "
"formation of human languages. The meaning of language in vector space "
"gradually emerges into the symbols in the system."
msgstr ""

#: templates/about.html:64
msgid ""
"As this new language is decipherable and learnable by humans, especially "
"Chinese speakers, it inherently challenges the existing paradigm where "
"humans are the linguistic authorities and machines are the learners."
